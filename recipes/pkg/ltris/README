********************
I.   Requirements
********************
LTris runs in X and uses SDL (any version though >= 1.1.4
is recommended) and SDL_mixer (optional for sound). Both libraries
can be found at http://libsdl.org. 

********************
II.  Installation
********************
Enter your favorite shell and type in the following stuff (in the
directory you extracted the LTris source)
> ./configure [--disable-sound] [--disable-install] [--disable-nls]
              [--localstatedir=HIDIR]
    --disable-sound:       no sound
    --with-buffer-size:    modify audio buffer size (set this value
                           to 2048 if you encounter any sound delays)
    --disable-install:     no installation; play from source directory
    --localstatedir:       install global highscores to this directory
                           REPLACES --with-highscore-path TO COMPLY 
                           WITH AUTOCONF; THE DEFAULT LOCATION NOW 
                           DEPENDS ON YOUR DISTRIBUTION: PREVIOUSLY 
                           IT WAS /var/lib/games. USE
                           --localstatedir=/var/lib/games
                           FOR EXISTING HIGHSCORES.
    --disable-nls          disable gettext support
> make
> su (become root)
> make install (if install wasn't disabled)
> exit (become user again)
> ltris (run game)

********************
III. Troubleshooting
********************
If you have SDL_mixer installed but configure tells you that it can't 
find it, remember that you have to install the development package
for compiling!
---
If you can't compile because LTris' timestamps are slightly in 
the future run 'touchall' (found in the configure directory).
---
If the SDL sound seems to be out of sync first try
to modify the audio buffer by using configure option 
--with-buffer-size (set to 2048). If this fails set
SDL_AUDIODRIVER to dma (export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dma).
  
********************
IV.  Localization
********************
This game now supports i18n. If you want to add l10n for your native language,
please contact me first, to prevent overlapping translations. A thorough
documentation can be found at 
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_mono/gettext.html
Basically, you will have to do the following:
  1) cd po
  2) add your language code (e.g., de for German) to the existing line in 
LINGUAS merely separated from the other languages by a blank
  3) run `msginit -o <LL>.po` with <LL> replaced by your language code
  4) translate the english message IDs in <LL>.po
  5) run make <LL>.gmo
Whenever you change something in your translation you'll have to repeat 
step 5). I strongly recommend to configure the program with --disable-install
while working on a translation. Otherwise you'd have to copy and rename the 
.gmo file as root every time you want to see your changes. If the source has 
been compiled without installation, only step 5) and simply running the game 
is required. (Of course, the enviroment variable LANG must be set to your 
locale.)
This should suffice. If not, please read the excellent documentation at 
gnu.org. The fonts do only contain the basic latin letters. No special letters
(like the german umlauts or any accents for example) are supported, so a l10n 
should not use them. If a string has a single %, meant as a percent sign, 
you'll have to manually remove the 'format' comment above the id (if any).
